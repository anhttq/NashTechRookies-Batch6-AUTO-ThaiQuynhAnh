Implicit wait and Explicit wait

1. Implicit wait
Implicit waits are used to provide a default waiting time between each consecutive test step/command across the entire 
test script. Thus, the subsequent test step would only execute when the fixed waiting time has elapsed after executing
the previous test step/command.

- The implicit wait is a single line of a code and can be declared in the setup method of the test script
- When compared to Explicit wait, the Implicit wait is transparent and uncomplicated. The syntax and approach are 
simpler than explicit wait.

2. Explicit wait
Explicit waits are used to halt the execution until the time a particular condition is met or the maximum time has elapsed. 
Unlike Implicit waits, Explicit waits are applied for a particular instance only.
